# Mapty
A simple web app to track your running and cycling routes and display them on the map according to the location. This app is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses the Geolocation API to get the user's current location and the Mapbox API to display the map. The app also uses the Local Storage API to store the user's data in the browser.

The user can add/modify/delete running and cycling events through the map interactively.
